This plugin started out as a set of personal mappings, but there was enough enjoyment among those I shared it with for me to clean it up and release it.

Features:

While there are several HTML and XML scripts on vim.org, I have found none that share a significant amount of functionality with allml.vim.

A huge variety of filetypes are supported:  html, xhtml, wml, xml, xslt, xsd, jsp, php, aspperl, aspvbs, cf, mason, htmldjango, and eruby.  (Let me know if I missed any).  Some features take note of the filetype and adapt to it.

Maps for editing tags.  This includes a couple of "make last word into a tag pair" maps, a doctype map (inserts <?xml ...?> in XML), a "close last tag" map, and a few extra goodies.

For templating languages (ASP, PHP, etc.), there are maps for inserting template code.  The maps are dependent on the filetype: in ASP, you get <% %> and <%= %>, in PHP, <?php ?> and <?php print ?>, etc.  If said template language has a comment syntax, there is a map for it, otherwise, that map points to <!-- -->.

Maps for XML/HTML escaping and URL encoding have been moved to unimpaired.vim, vimscript #1590.

Enhances surround.vim, vimscript #1697.
